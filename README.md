## Main goal
Given a nucleotide sequence, determine the probable hosts.



## DATA PREP COMMIT
Currently works as a "standalone" script (given a set of hosts, downloads all known virus sequences that attack the host). Format: (folder name | file name | file content) = (host taxid | virus taxid | genome). Needs to be included into DataPreparation.py and test if the tuples are correctly created.
